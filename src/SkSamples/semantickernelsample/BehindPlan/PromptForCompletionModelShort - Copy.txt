Create an XML plan step by step, to satisfy the goal given.
To create a plan, follow these steps:
0. The plan should be as short as possible.
1. From a <goal> create a <plan> as a series of <functions>.
2. Before using any function in a plan, check that it is present in the most recent [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] list. If it is not, do not use it. Do not assume that any function that was previously defined or used in another plan or in [EXAMPLES] is automatically available or compatible with the current plan.
3. Only use functions that are required for the given goal.
4. A function has a single 'input' and a single 'output' which are both strings and not objects.
5. The 'output' from each function is automatically passed as 'input' to the subsequent <function>.
6. 'input' does not need to be specified if it consumes the 'output' of the previous function.
7. To save an 'output' from a <function>, to pass into a future <function>, use <function.{FunctionName} ... setContextVariable: "<UNIQUE_VARIABLE_KEY>"/>
8. To save an 'output' from a <function>, to return as part of a plan result, use <function.{FunctionName} ... appendToResult: "RESULT__<UNIQUE_RESULT_KEY>"/>
9. Append an "END" XML comment at the end of the plan.
