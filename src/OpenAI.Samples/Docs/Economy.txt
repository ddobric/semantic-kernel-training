IMF lifts UK growth forecast this year
Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund has lifted its forecast for UK economic growth this year.

Following an annual check-up on the British economy, the IMF has upgraded the UK’s expected growth rate this year to 1.2% from 1.1%, and reassured us that an “economic recovery is under way”.

This reverse some of the IMF’s downgrade last month, when it cut the UK’s predicted growth this year from 1.6% to 1.1%.

It follows the UK economy’s decent start to 2025, with growth of 0.7% recorded in the January-March quarter.

Luc Eyraud, the IMF’s mission chief to the United Kingdom, told reporters in London this morning:

“These revisions reflect the strong GDP performance in the first quarter, reflecting the resilience of the UK economy despite the complex external environment.”

However, looking ahead, the IMF also warns that trade tensions linked to US tariff plans will reduce UK economic growth next year.

It expects global trade tensions will wipe 0.3 percentage points off growth for the year, but is still predicting growth will increase to 1.4% in 2026.

Trade tensions will weigh on growth through “persistent uncertainty, slower activity in UK trading partners, and the direct impact of remaining US tariffs on the UK”, the IMF warns.
