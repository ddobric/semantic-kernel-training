# Agent Framework Samples

This solution demonstrates how to build AI agents using the **Microsoft Agent Framework** with Azure OpenAI and OpenAI backends. The entry point for the hosted Azure scenarios is the `HelloAgent` class in `HostedAgentsWithAzureFoundryModels/1_HelloAgent.cs`.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 10
- An Azure OpenAI resource with a deployed chat model
- Environment variables configured (see [Configuration](#configuration))
- Azure CLI logged in (`az login`) for `DefaultAzureCredential`

## Configuration

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | Azure OpenAI endpoint URL |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT` | Model deployment name |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key (for non-Azure samples) |
| `OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL_NAME` | OpenAI model name (defaults to `gpt-5.4-mini`) |

## Agent Scenarios

### Scenario 1 — Agent Construction and Basic Usage (`RunAsync`)

The simplest scenario: create an agent and invoke it.

**How it works:**

1. An `AzureOpenAIClient` is created using `DefaultAzureCredential` for authentication.
2. A `ChatClient` is obtained for the target model deployment.
3. The `AsAIAgent()` extension method wraps the `ChatClient` into an `AIAgent`, which is the central abstraction in the Agent Framework. You provide `instructions` (the system prompt) and a `name`.
4. The agent is invoked in two ways:
   - **Non-streaming** (`RunAsync`) — sends the prompt and waits for the complete `AgentResponse`.
   - **Streaming** (`RunStreamingAsync`) — returns an `IAsyncEnumerable<AgentResponseUpdate>`, yielding incremental text chunks as they arrive from the model. This is ideal for real-time console or UI output.

```
AzureOpenAIClient → ChatClient → AIAgent
                                     ↓
                              RunAsync("prompt")  →  AgentResponse (full text)
                              RunStreamingAsync()  →  AgentResponseUpdate (chunks)
```

### Scenario 2 — Sessions and Multi-turn Conversations (`RunMultiturnAsync`)

Demonstrates the difference between stateless and stateful (session-based) conversations.

**The problem with stateless calls:**

By default, each call to `RunAsync` is independent. The agent has no memory of what was said before. If you ask *"Calculate 1+2+...+10"* and then *"Now add 1"*, the second call has no idea what *"all"* refers to — it lacks conversational context.

**The solution — `AgentSession`:**

An `AgentSession` object accumulates the conversation history (all user and assistant messages) across multiple `RunAsync` calls. When you pass the same session to each call, the agent sees the full conversation and can correctly interpret follow-up prompts.

```
Without session:                    With session:
┌─────────────┐                     ┌─────────────┐
│ "Sum 1..10" │ → 55                │ "Sum 1..10" │ → 55        ← history: [turn 1]
│ "Add 1"     │ → ??? (no context)  │ "Add 1"     │ → 56        ← history: [turn 1, 2]
│ "Divide /2" │ → ??? (no context)  │ "Divide /2" │ → 28        ← history: [turn 1, 2, 3]
└─────────────┘                     └─────────────┘
```

**Key API:**

- `agent.CreateSessionAsync()` — creates a new empty session.
- `agent.RunAsync(prompt, session)` — invokes the agent within the session context.

---

### Scenario 3 — Function Tools (`RunWithToolsAsync`)

Shows how to give the agent access to local C# methods it can call autonomously.

**How it works:**

1. A regular C# method (`GetProcessInfo`) is decorated with `[Description]` attributes that tell the agent what the function does and what each parameter means.
2. `AIFunctionFactory.Create(GetProcessInfo)` wraps the method into an `AITool` that the Agent Framework can register with the model.
3. The `tools` parameter of `AsAIAgent()` registers the tool. When the agent determines a user question requires the tool (e.g., *"Show me running processes"*), it automatically:
   - Generates a function call with the appropriate arguments.
   - Executes the local C# method.
   - Incorporates the result into its response.

**Tool definition pattern:**

```csharp
[Description("What this tool does — visible to the model")]
static string MyTool(
    [Description("Parameter description — visible to the model")] string param)
{
    // Your logic here
    return result;
}
```

The `[Description]` attributes are critical — they are the only way the model knows when and how to use the tool.

## Workflows

The Agent Framework includes a lightweight workflow engine that connects **executors** (processing units) via typed message edges into a directed graph. Workflows can range from simple deterministic pipelines to complex AI-driven feedback loops.

### Scenario 1 — Linear Pipeline (`RunAsync`)

The simplest possible workflow — a **linear two-step pipeline** with no AI involved. It demonstrates the core workflow mechanics in isolation.

**Pipeline:**

```
Input: "Hello, World!"
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────┐       ┌──────────────────────┐
│ UppercaseExecutor│──────▶│ ReverseTextExecutor  │──── Output
│  (lambda)        │       │  (custom Executor)   │
└──────────────────┘       └──────────────────────┘
       ↓                          ↓
  "HELLO, WORLD!"           "!DLROW ,OLLEH"
```

**Key concepts demonstrated:**

| Concept | How it's shown |
|---|---|
| **Lambda executor** | A `Func<string, string>` bound as an executor via `BindAsExecutor()` — no subclassing needed for simple transforms. |
| **Custom executor** | `ReverseTextExecutor` extends `Executor<string, string>` with a typed `HandleAsync` method. |
| **WorkflowBuilder** | `AddEdge(a, b)` connects executors; `WithOutputFrom(b)` marks which executor yields the final result. |
| **Synchronous run** | `InProcessExecution.RunAsync` runs the workflow to completion and returns a `Run` object with all `NewEvents`. |
| **ExecutorCompletedEvent** | Each executor emits this event when it finishes, carrying the executor ID and output data. |

**When to use this pattern:** Pre/post-processing pipelines, data transformation chains, or any workflow where you want deterministic step-by-step processing without LLM calls.

### Scenario 2 — Inter-Executor Messaging (`RunWithMessagingAsync`)

Extends the linear pipeline to a **four-step chain** and introduces two advanced workflow features: **inter-executor messaging** via `SendMessageAsync` and **custom domain events** via `AddEventAsync`.

**Pipeline:**

```
Input: "Hello, World!"
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│ UppercaseExecutor│────▶│ ReverseTextExecutor │────▶│  MyExecutor2   │────▶│  MyExecutor1   │── Output
│  (lambda)        │     │  (Executor<s,s>)    │     │  (Executor<s,s>)│     │  (Executor)    │
└──────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘     └───────┬────────┘     └───────┬────────┘
                                                             │                      │
                                                     SendMessageAsync ──────▶ [MessageHandler]
                                                       (MyEvent1)          Handle2Async(MyEvent1)
                                                                                    │
                                                                             AddEventAsync
                                                                              (MyEvent2)
```

**How messaging works:**

1. `MyExecutor2` processes the string from its edge input, then calls `context.SendMessageAsync(new MyEvent1(...))` to dispatch a typed message.
2. `MyExecutor1` has two `[MessageHandler]` methods — one for `string` (the edge data) and one for `MyEvent1` (the sent message). The workflow engine routes each message to the matching handler automatically.
3. When `MyExecutor1` handles the `MyEvent1`, it emits a `MyEvent2` via `context.AddEventAsync(...)`. This event appears in the `run.NewEvents` stream for watchers but does **not** trigger any executor — it is purely for observability.

**Key concepts demonstrated:**

| Concept | How it's shown |
|---|---|
| **`SendMessageAsync`** | `MyExecutor2` sends a `MyEvent1` message to any executor that can handle it, independent of the edge graph. |
| **`[MessageHandler]` routing** | `MyExecutor1` uses the untyped `Executor` base with `partial class` and `[MessageHandler]` attributes. The source generator wires up type-based dispatch so each handler receives only its matching message type. |
| **`[SendsMessage]` attribute** | Declared on `MyExecutor2` to tell the workflow engine which message types it may send — enables compile-time/build-time validation. |
| **Custom domain events** | `MyEvent2` is emitted via `AddEventAsync` for observability. Unlike `SendMessageAsync`, events do not route to executors — they are for external watchers only. |
| **Event stream inspection** | The event loop distinguishes `ExecutorCompletedEvent`, custom `MyEvent2` (highlighted in green), and other events. |

## Complex Workflow Example (`4_ComplexWorkflow.cs`)

Demonstrates a **multi-agent feedback loop** where two AI executors collaborate iteratively to produce a polished slogan.

### Concept

The workflow follows a graph-based execution model inspired by the [Pregel BSP pattern](https://kowshik.github.io/JPregel/pregel_paper.pdf). Two executors communicate by passing typed messages along directed edges:

```
          SloganResult                  FeedbackResult
┌──────────────┐        ┌───────────────────┐
│ SloganWriter │───────▶│ FeedbackProvider  │
│  (Executor)  │◀───────│    (Executor)     │
└──────────────┘        └───────────────────┘
     │ handles:               │ handles:
     │  string (initial)      │  SloganResult
     │  FeedbackResult        │
     │  (revision)            │ decides:
     │                        │  ✓ Accept (rating ≥ 8)
     │                        │  ✗ Reject (max 3 attempts)
     │                        │  ↻ Loop (send feedback back)
```

### Components

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| **`SloganWriterExecutor`** | Generates or revises slogans. Has two `[MessageHandler]` methods: one for the initial `string` prompt, one for `FeedbackResult` revisions. Uses structured JSON output (`ResponseFormat`). |
| **`FeedbackExecutor`** | Reviews slogans and produces a `FeedbackResult` with comments, a 1–10 rating, and suggested actions. Decides whether to accept, reject, or loop. |
| **`SloganResult`** | Data contract carrying the task description and generated slogan. |
| **`FeedbackResult`** | Data contract carrying review comments, numeric rating, and improvement actions. |
| **`SloganGeneratedEvent` / `FeedbackEvent`** | Custom `WorkflowEvent` subclasses emitted for observability — watchers see progress in real time. |

### Workflow Lifecycle

1. **Build the graph** — `WorkflowBuilder` connects the two executors with bidirectional edges and marks `FeedbackExecutor` as the output source.
2. **Run with streaming** — `InProcessExecution.RunStreamingAsync` starts the workflow. Events are consumed via `WatchStreamAsync()`.
3. **Iteration loop:**
   - The `SloganWriter` generates a slogan → emits `SloganGeneratedEvent`.
   - The `FeedbackProvider` reviews it → emits `FeedbackEvent`.
   - If the rating ≥ `MinimumRating` (default 8), the slogan is accepted via `YieldOutputAsync`.
   - If `MaxAttempts` (default 3) is reached, the workflow stops with the last slogan.
   - Otherwise, the `FeedbackResult` is sent back to `SloganWriter` for revision.
4. **Output** — The final accepted (or best-effort) slogan is yielded as a `WorkflowOutputEvent`.

### Key Patterns

- **Structured output** — Both executors use `ChatResponseFormat.ForJsonSchema<T>()` to force the model to return valid JSON matching the data contracts.
- **Session persistence** — Each executor lazily creates an `AgentSession`, preserving conversation history across loop iterations so the agent can build on prior feedback.
- **Message-based routing** — The `[MessageHandler]` attribute and `partial class` with source generators wire up type-based message dispatch automatically.
- **Observability** — Custom `WorkflowEvent` subclasses provide a structured event stream that callers can monitor, log, or display.
